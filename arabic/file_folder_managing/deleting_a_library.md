# Deleting a Library

You can delete a library owned by you. A deleted library can be restored by you or Seafile server's administrator.

After a library is deleted, it has following effects:

* Share of the files and folders within this library are all canceled.
* Desktop clients synced with this library cannot sync with it any more. But the local files on the client won't be deleted.
